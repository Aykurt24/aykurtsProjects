Type Casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.

@In Java there are two types of casting.@

    1.Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size.

    2.Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller type size.
