@ HashMap ==> makes no guarantees on the iteration order of the map. Also addition and removal of any elements might
    change its iteration order.

@ LinkedHashMap ==> it defines the iteration order which is the order in which keys were inserted into the map.

@ TreeMap ==> on the order hand, is iterated accordingly to the natural ordering of its keys.

@ HashMap and LinkedHashMap permits null value and null key but TreeMap permits only null values (not null keys).


                                    ~~~ Which implementation to use ? ~~~

@ We can use HashMap when performance is critical and ordering of keys doesn't matter.

@ We can use TreeMap when keys needs to be ordered using their natural ordering.

@ We can use LinkedHashMap if insertion order of the keys should be preserved.
