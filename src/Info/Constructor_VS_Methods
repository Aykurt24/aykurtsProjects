What are your daily activities (What do you do when you are going to work) (Daily routine) All same question?

I am going to work at 8:45 am because I have a daily stand up at 9 am. In the daily stand up We are talking on
what I did yesterday What I am going to do today and is there any blockers.

After that it is depend on my sprint. If we just started sprint, I am attending the sprint planning meeting.
In the sprint planning we are talking about which user stories we are going to work on.

If it is second or third day in the sprint probably, I don’t have any user stories in the QA so
I am creating the test cases for the user stories and also I am working on automating the test cases from the regression.

If it is middle of the sprint, I am testing the user stories in the sprint.

If it is end of the sprint, I am attending the sprint review and sprint retro meetings.
In the sprint review we are reviewing the user stories which we worked on or doing demo.
In the retro we are talking what we did good in the sprint and what we need to improve.




What is this mean “I am working on automating the test cases from the regression”

	Regression: Before each deploy, we are doing a regression test and it is basically testing the all functionalities
	in the application.
