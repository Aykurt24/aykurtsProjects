@ Checked exceptions are before I run (Execute) the code. I am able to see the error. Java letting me know. I am usually
using try and catch to handle it.
@ We can handle it by using try catch block and throws keyword. Otherwise the program will give a compilation error.



@ Uncheked exceptions are not checked at complie time.
@ If we did not handle or declare that exception the program won't give compilation error
@ All uncheked exceptions are sub classes of Runtime Exception class.
    1- NullPointerException
    2- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException
    3- ArithmeticException
    4- IllegalArgumentException  ==>
    5- NumberFormatException
