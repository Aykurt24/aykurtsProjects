@ Encapsulation ==> The meaning of encapsulation is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve
  this, you must:

  ==> declare class variables/attributes as PRIVATE

  ==> provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a PRIVATE variable.

  public Set and Get methods provide us to access private variables.

  ==> Get method returns the variable value.

  ==> Set method sets the value.

@ Get and Set methods followed by the name of the variable, with the first letter in upper case

                           Get                        VS                    Set

                @ does not have a parameter.                        @ it has a parameter.
